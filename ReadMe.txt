Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?

We are looking to solve the lack of noise control in classrooms.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

Noise Control seeks to help teachers maintain a quiet classroom by providing an engaging "game" that only works when the volume of the classroom is low enough.

- What is the mission statement?

We aim to provide the best resource possible for teachers looking to maintain a quiet and peaceful classroom.

Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
- Are you required to pay to use the API?
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)


Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

Teachers, specifically elementary/middle school teachers.

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

Love the concept, would be great to see it in action.

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
