        <h1>What is Noise Control?</h1>
        <p>Noise controller is an app designed to help teachers maintain a quiet classroom. It consists of a virtual environment in which animals can appear on screen when the kids are quiet enough.   </p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>In the app, teachers can choose settings for volume control and the intervals at which the animals appear on the screen. They can also choose different environments, such as jungle, safari, or ocean. If the classroom is quiet, animals will fill the screen at an interval chosen by the teacher. If the the volume of the classroom gets too high, the animals will be scared off the screen. See how many different animals your class can collect each day! </p>

        <h2>What Makes Noise Control Different?</h2>
        <p>There are several apps available for noise control currently, however we found that many of them actually seemed to encourage noise rather than encouraging quiet. Noise Controller seeks to help this problem by having a constant and boring response to noise. It's more fun to see what new animal will appear by being quiet, than watching all the animals disappear if there is too much noise.</p>
